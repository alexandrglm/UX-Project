# DevCamp Support Platform

## **Primary Objective**
1. Provide a bi-directional communication space for students and mentors to discuss and resolve doubts related to DevCamp guides and lessons.
2. Track course progress.
3. Build and continuously update a Knowledge Database.  

### **Key Features**
- The support platform must be accessible to students:
  * Requires user authentication using the same credentials as the DevCamp platform.
  * Supports Markdown text editing for rich formatting.  

- The platform should serve as a **collective knowledge hub**:
  * Search queries retrieve relevant previous tickets based on matching keywords, increasing the value of the query.

- **The real added value comes when a mentor resolves a new issue:**
  * The responses become part of the DevCamp Knowledge Database for future reference.

**Highlighted in green**, one of the key advantages is that when typing the first words of the Subject—where conciseness is required—these become **Keywords** that the app uses to query the Knowledge Database, displaying potential previous solutions.

### **03 - Final Approach: A Step Before UI Planning**

All queries made become part of the **Knowledge Database** for future reference.  

**This is one of the key user experiences, as illustrated in the initial sitemap.**
